# Heart Disease Prediction Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on various health metrics and attributes. It utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze a dataset containing features like age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, etc., to make predictions about the presence of heart disease.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Dataset Source]. It contains [number] instances with [number] features including:

- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type
- Resting blood pressure
- Serum cholesterol
- Fasting blood sugar
- Resting electrocardiographic results
- Maximum heart rate achieved
- Exercise-induced angina
- ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
- Thallium stress test result
- Target: Presence of heart disease (0 for no, 1 for yes)

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn

## Usage
1. Navigate to the directory where the project is cloned.
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
3. Open and run the `heart_disease_prediction.ipynb` notebook.
4. Follow the instructions within the notebook to train the model and make predictions.

## Model Evaluation
The performance of the machine learning model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, visualizations such as confusion matrices and ROC curves are used to assess the model's performance.
## Future Improvements
- Collect more diverse and comprehensive data to improve model accuracy.
- Experiment with different machine learning algorithms and hyperparameters to enhance predictive performance.
- Implement feature engineering techniques to extract more meaningful information from the data.
- Explore advanced techniques such as ensemble learning and neural networks for better predictions.
